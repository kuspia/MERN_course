so that means basically this will be rendered in the root div of ```index.html``` which is our main website stuff.

u see we get a deployed URL on some IP to test it on other device too at the same time.

```
function App() {
  return (
    <div>
     HEELELO
    </div>
  );
}
```

see above is ```JSS``` which is JS + HTML 

see inside <div> u cn write HTML and outisde that you can write JS, u can also use {} inside div to write JS inside it
